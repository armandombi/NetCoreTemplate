## NetCoreTemplate

This project contains a simple MVC .net application created using .net core 2.1, the idea is to setup a simple enviroment using React, .Net Core, Bootstrap 4 and Webpack, to work on any future projects.  

## Motivation

The reason i created this template is due to the fact that the current .Net Core MVC react template still uses bootstrap 3 and this reaises some vulnerabilities issues on any new projects, so i decided to create a basic template, using the tools i like to work wih and learn how to do this in the process. I Also aim to practice some basic React concepts as well as getting more into to the .Net Core framework. 

## Installation

To run this project simply:

  - Clone the repository or download the zip containing the code and unzip this to your desired working folder.
  - Open a console in your working folder where the code was unzipped.
  - Run `npm install`to gather all the required dependencies. In my case i am using Yarn so you can also use `yarn`
  - Run `dotnet build` to build the project.
  - Run `dotnet run` to initialize the project, you will see two links indicating that he project is running and clicking on any of them will pop a new browser with the app running.
